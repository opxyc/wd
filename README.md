Monitor servers through plug in scripts.

Three components:

[**Client**](cmd/client)s running on multiple servers(that are to be monitored). Requires a configuration file with format mentioned below and runs the tasks mentioned in the conf file. On error, it sends message to **server**.

```
Usage of ./client:
  -c string
        path to cfg file (default "config.json")
  -r string
        server address in the format IP:PORT (default "localhost:40090")
  -sl string
        client specific log directory (default "log/self")
  -tl string
        task execution log directory (default "log/task")
```
The [**Server**](cmd/server) is a gRPC server listening on port 40090. Multiple **client**s can connect to it and share errors/alerts. It then broadcasts the same to **wdc**s. Server also runs a http server for ws connections on port 40080.

```
Usage of ./server:
  -l string
        log directory (default "log")
```

[**wdc**](cmd/wdc)s are clients that run on monitoring spoc's local machines. It connects to the **server** through websockets and listens to incoming alerts and logs to `$HOME/WatchDog-Client/log` directory. It also includes an http server listening on port 8080 with a single end point `/{id}` which returns details of the alert with given `id`.

```
Usage of wdc: 
    wdcx COMMAND

    Commands:
        start - listen to incoming alerts
            -ep string
                connection endpoint for -r (default "/ws/connect")
            -r string
                http server address (default "localhost:40080")

        get {id} - prints details of an alert given it's id
```

## Configuration file format
type: JSON

```js
{
    "hostname": "h0stnam3",
        // (optional)
        // If not specified, the client will try to get system hostname.
        // Else, `hostname` will be used.
    "tasks": [
        {
            "name": "foo",
                // (optional)
                // Note: `name` can be helpful to distinguish tasks while reading log files,
                // so, it's recommended to give one (ideally separated with dashes).
            "repeatInterval": 60,
                // (required)
                // the time interval after which the task should repeat itself

                // The command/script to execute.
                // Note: If the script failed with exit code != 0, it will trigger an alert.
            "msg": "some message that is to be sent to monitoring spoc when cmd fails",
                // (required)
                // the message that will sent upon failure of script mentioned in `cmd`
            "actionsToBeTaken": [
                // (optional)
                // represents the actions to be taken when task fails.

                    "continueOnFailure": true
                        // (optional)
                        // To inform the client whether or not to proceed with the next action in the list.
                        // If not mentioned, it wont' proceed to next action if current actions fails.
                },

                }
            ]
        },

### Alert Behaviour
| If | Will alert be sent? | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cmd` completes successfully | No | No alerts. Logs "task completed successfully". |
| `cmd` fails | Yes | Will log the error and output; and:<br/>If `actionsToBeTaken` is mentioned, will proceed with it's execution and then send an alert accordingly: <br/><ul><li>If all actions succeeds, it will send an alert with final status as "OK"</li> <li> If any one of the listed action(s) fails, it will mention "actions failed to complete" in the alert sent.</li></ul> Else, it will simply send an alert. |
